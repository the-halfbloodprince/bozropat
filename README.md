# Bozropat [WIP]

Bozropat, which means lightning in Assamese, has always been one of the coolest words I've come across. This is a page, kindof my own portfolio(if later I decide to pick up my name as Bozropat instead of my current 'halfbloodprince').

This is an attempt by me at trying something creative in web design and development.

The page picks up a random bar colour out of a list I have specified in script.js currently. Will be exporting it to a separate .json file very soon.

The scroll animations are linked with the help of the ScrollTrigger plugin by gsap.
